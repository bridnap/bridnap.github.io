<p>These are just a few of the apps and website I've generated over the years.  I've had many more, but these are selected because they are still active.</p>
        	    <h2><a href="http://bridnap.github.io/rtsearch/">Routing and Transit Number Search</a></h2>
        		<p><span class="date-stamp">MAY 2018&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I work float in my financial sector, 8-5 position, and I needed an easier way to search for the bank names when I only have the RT. I'm using a simple JSON data format in the background.  This app could basically be re-provisioned for any type of small data query.  Review the <a href="https://github.com/bridnap/rtsearch">code</a>.</p><br><br>
        	
			    <h2><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/213588312/">Game via MIT Scratch</a></h2>
				<p><span class="date-stamp">MAY 2018&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This was part of a project in finishing my education degree at Mississippi State University.  We had to find a way to interest 12-13 year old children in learning basic programming skills.  The idea was for it to be a small enough project to only take a week yet also still yield an actual game.  Scratch by MIT fits that bill in a number of ways.  The game is simple, but the knowledge gained is definitely there.  See the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/213588312/editor">code</a>.</p><br><br>
				
			    <h2><a href="https://bridnap.github.io/comicbrowser/">Comic Browser</a></h2>
        		<p><span class="date-stamp">NOVEMBER 2017&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Smallish website to kinda map out how I would expand upon the Comic Covers website.  When you get into something like this, it's easy to detail, but very difficult to maintain as there is so much data associated with comic books.  Still, it works and would work well as a static html driven site.  See the <a href="https://github.com/bridnap/comicbrowser">code</a>.</p><br><br> 
			    
				<h2><a href="https://bridnap.github.io/notepad/">Nothing Notepad</a></h2>
        		<p><span class="date-stamp">NOVEMBER 2017&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Most of the applications I write are just to see if <i>I can</i>.  This is one of those.  I probably lifted a lot of the code from others in attempting to learn how to write this, so I can't claim it all as mine.  See the <a href="https://github.com/bridnap/notepad">code</a>.</p><br><br>
				
				<h2><a href="https://codepen.io/bridnap/pen/wPqPzr">Bootstrap Login</a></h2>
				<p><span class="date-stamp">NOVEMBER 2017&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Most applications we purchase have login screens already installed, and for the most part they work really well.  However in one odd case, we decided we needed to streamline those login screens.  This was my suggestion that I worked up really quickly through Codepen using Bootstrap for the initial template.

				<h2><a href="https://bridnap.github.io/little-popper">The Little Popper</a></h2>
        		<p><span class="date-stamp">JANUARY 2017&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My niece owns a local gourmet popcorn store, and I generated this site as a test in case they wanted to move to a local-only type of experience.  The original code for this came from Creative Tim as a Bootstrap site.  So this served as a training course to help me learn Bootstrap.  See the <a href="https://github.com/bridnap/little-popper">code</a>.</p><br><br>
				
        		<h2><a href="http://bridnap.github.io/git-ref/">Git Quick Reference</a></h2>
        		<p><span class="date-stamp">JULY 2016&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This is the base source app I used in writing my Git Quick Reference guide that was finally ported to Google Play. It's very simplistic, but for someone that doesn't use Git extensively daily, it does help a lot!  Without looking at it too hard, it's just static html code.  I used a little Jekyll and YAML in building it, but for the most part, it's just static code.  Review the <a href="https://github.com/bridnap/git-ref">code</a>.</p><br><br>
				
				<h2><a href="http://bridnap.github.io/whatismyip/">What Is My IP?</a></h2>
        		<p><span class="date-stamp">MAY 2016&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I built this because I needed a simple IP address identifier from a site that would not be blocked by my company's firewall administrators. One can of course just use Google search and that'll get you the right information most of the time. However, for dual verification, this works well.  It's using the IpIfy API, making this tiny app extremely easy to setup.  See the <a href="https://github.com/bridnap/whatismyip">code</a>.</p><br><br>
        	
				<h2><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minimal-hacker-news/jgijakambklliabpigfklccjjpinnloi">Minimal Hacker News Chrome</a></h2>
        		<p><span class="date-stamp">MAY 2016&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I browse Hacker News a lot, but even on that site, I can get lost for awhile just browsing.  So I was looking for a way to see the top stories for the day. Most of the code is borrowed in an attempt at learning how to build a neat little Chrome Extension app.  See the <a href="https://github.com/bridnap/hnchrome/">code</a>.</p><br><br>
