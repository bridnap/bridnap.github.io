### Overview

Hello!  I am Brian and I live in north Mississippi. My career has strictly been within the Info Tech of the financial industry. I’ve grown into this career through a start as  Mainframe Computer Operator, then Production Control Analyst, z/OS System Programmer, and a myriad of other touches in the field of check processing and managed file transmissions. Today I’m a Vice President in financial Info Tech over most of the groups mentioned previously as well as playing an integral part over a large number of bank conversions.
<br/><br/>
I’m a ‘70’s-‘80’s kid, so I grew up with Atari’s, Apple IIc’s, and Nintendo systems, basically the golden age of all personal computing and gaming. I dabbled then and I dabble now as you’ll see from my apps. To the chagrin of my children, I spend a lot of my free time with Fortnite. It’s just the easiest game to pick up and play.

### Sample List of Apps Created Over Time
I've been writing small bits of code since the Apple IIc days.  I rarely write full fledged applications.  Instead, I focus on small task oriented types of coding projects.  Below are a few that are publicly available.
<br/><br/>
- [Routing and Transit Number Search](http://bridnap.github.io/rtsearch) | **MAY 2018** | I work float in my financial sector, 8-5 position, and I needed an easier way to search for the bank names when I only have the RT. I'm using a simple JSON data format in the background.  This app could basically be re-provisioned for any type of small data query.  Review the [code](https://github.com/bridnap/rtsearch).
<br/><br/>    	
- [Funky Game via MIT Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/213588312) | **MAY 2018** | This was part of a project in finishing my education degree at Mississippi State University.  We had to find a way to interest 12-13 year old children in learning basic programming skills.  The idea was for it to be a small enough project to only take a week yet also still yield an actual game.  Scratch by MIT fits that bill in a number of ways.  The game is simple, but the knowledge gained is definitely there.  See the [code](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/213588312/editor).
<br/><br/> 				
- [BancorpSouth Login](https://codepen.io/bridnap/pen/wPqPzr) | **NOVEMBER 2017** | Most applications we purchase have login screens already installed, and for the most part they work really well.  However in one odd case, we decided we needed to streamline those login screens.  This was my suggestion that I worked up really quickly through Codepen using Bootstrap for the initial template.
<br/><br/>
- [Comic Book Browser](https://bridnap.github.io/comicbrowser) | **NOVEMBER 2017** | Smallish website to kinda map out how I would expand upon the Comic Covers website.  When you get into something like this, it's easy to detail, but very difficult to maintain as there is so much data associated with comic books.  Still, it works and would work well as a static html driven site.  See the [code](https://github.com/bridnap/comicbrowser). 
<br/><br/>		    
- [The Nothing Notepad](https://bridnap.github.io/notepad) | **NOVEMBER 2017** | Most of the applications I write are just to see if <i>I can</i>.  This is one of those.  I probably lifted a lot of the code from others in attempting to learn how to write this, so I can't claim it all as mine.  See the [code](https://github.com/bridnap/notepad).
<br/><br/>				
- [The Little Popper](https://bridnap.github.io/little-popper) | **JANUARY 2017** | My niece owns a local gourmet popcorn store, and I generated this site as a test in case they wanted to move to a local-only type of experience.  The original code for this came from Creative Tim as a Bootstrap site.  So this served as a training course to help me learn Bootstrap.  See the [code](https://github.com/bridnap/little-popper).
<br/><br/>				
- [Git Quick Reference](http://bridnap.github.io/git-ref) | **JULY 2016** | This is the base source app I used in writing my Git Quick Reference guide that was finally ported to Google Play. It's very simplistic, but for someone that doesn't use Git extensively daily, it does help a lot!  Without looking at it too hard, it's just static html code.  I used a little Jekyll and YAML in building it, but for the most part, it's just static code.  Review the [code](https://github.com/bridnap/git-ref).
<br/><br/>				
- [What Is My IP?](http://bridnap.github.io/whatismyip) | **MAY 2016** | I built this because I needed a simple IP address identifier from a site that would not be blocked by my company's firewall administrators. One can of course just use Google search and that'll get you the right information most of the time. However, for dual verification, this works well.  It's using the IpIfy API, making this tiny app extremely easy to setup.  See the [code](https://github.com/bridnap/whatismyip).
<br/><br/>    	
- [Minimal Hacker News Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minimal-hacker-news/jgijakambklliabpigfklccjjpinnloi) | **MAY 2016** | I browse Hacker News a lot, but even on that site, I can get lost for awhile just browsing.  So I was looking for a way to see the top stories for the day. Most of the code is borrowed in an attempt at learning how to build a neat little Chrome Extension app.  See the [code](https://github.com/bridnap/hnchrome).

### Web Portfolio
- [Find Cheap Bargains](https://web.archive.org/web/20130122221126/http://findcheapbargains.com/) | In the age of affiliate marketing between 2007 and 2012, I ran this site along with 26 smaller sites.  I can't say that I was proud of them all. A lot of the others were just money grabs because it was easy at the time to throw up some long tail search pages with eBay and Amazon items and profit.  But I was proud of this one.  I did a ton of research on each and every item I posted.  I bought a great deal of them myself, and never got a single product for free.  There was about 5 years of writing on this site, each post equalling around 500-750 words.  The site is gone now, but the Wayback Machine holds onto at least a snapshot of it forever.
