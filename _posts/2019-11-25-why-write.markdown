I used to write a lot.  Like 500-1,000 words per day.  But I fell out of it for about 6 years now.  When I first stopped, I was so sick of it, I didn't care if I kept doing it.  Not that I've been out of it for awhile...well now I miss it.  So I'm going back to it with this blog.  Is it a waste of time?  It could be, and I could easily stop it tomorrow on a whim.  I think I'll try it again though, just for a while, and see how it goes.
