### Miscellaneous Notes
- If I can't get the server to start, it might be due to admin rights.  Not necessarily because I am nor am not an Admin (my user usually is).  But because the system itself wants the "First Steps" action to be run as an administrator.  Right-click, Run as Admin works wonders.
