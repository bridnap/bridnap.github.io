### Random Excel Helps

- Select an entire column and press CTRL-D to make the formula populate the entire way down.  Choose only the cells you want to keep it from going too far.
- To generate currency out of a chain of numbers use =TEXT(A1,"$ ###,### ;") where A1 is the first cell.  The comma can be moved around.
